<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Seoul National University in 2018. I am currently working toward the integrated M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering at Seoul National University. 

My current research interests include multi-camera object classification & detection, efficient data collection & annotation, and learning from noisy labels.
